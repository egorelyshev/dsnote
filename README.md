## Description

<br/>

Faster Whisper, Coqui TTS and Mimic3 models are only available on x86-64.

Language models can be downloaded directly from the app.

Details of models which are currently configured for download are described in
[models.json (GitHub)](https://github.com/mkiol/dsnote/blob/main/config/models.json) or
[models.json (GitLab)](https://gitlab.com/mkiol/dsnote/-/blob/main/config/models.json).

## How to install

- Linux Desktop: [Flatpak](https://flathub.org/apps/net.mkiol.SpeechNote)
- Arch Linux (AUR):
  - [dsnote](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/dsnote)
  - [dsnote-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/dsnote-git)
- Sailfish OS: [OpenRepos](https://openrepos.net/content/mkiol/speech-note)

### Flatpak packages

Starting from v4.4.0, the app distributed via Flatpak (published on Flathub) consists of the following packages:

 - Base package "Speech Note" (net.mkiol.SpeechNote)
 - Add-on for AMD graphics card "Speech Note AMD" (net.mkiol.SpeechNote.Addon.amd)
 - Add-on for NVIDIA graphics card "Speech Note NVIDIA" (net.mkiol.SpeechNote.Addon.nvidia)

Base package includes all the dependencies needed to run every feature of the application.
Add-ons add the capability of GPU acceleration, which speeds up some operations in the application.

Base package and add-ons contain many "heavy" libraries like CUDA, ROCm, Torch and Python libraries.
Due to this, the size of the packages and the space required after installation are significant.
If you don't need all the functionalities, you can use much smaller "Tiny" package
(available on [Releases](https://github.com/mkiol/dsnote/releases/tag/v4.4.0) page),
which provides only the basic features. If you need, you can also use "Tiny" packages together with GPU acceleration add-on.

Comparison between Base, Tiny and Add-ons Flatpak packages:

### Beta version

In addition to the stable version in the Flathub repository, you can try to test the "Beta" version of the upcoming release. This version is usable, but may contain more bugs.

Beta version is available in "flathub-beta" repository. Follow [these instructions](https://discourse.flathub.org/t/how-to-use-flathub-beta/2111) to enable flathub-beta on your computer.

## Building from sources

### Arch Linux

It is also possible to build and install the latest development (git) or latest stable (release) version from the repository using the provided PKGBUILD file (please note that the same remarks about building on Linux apply):

```
git clone <git repository url>

cd dsnote/arch/git      # build latest git version
# or
cd dsnote/arch/release  # build latest release version

makepkg -si
```

### Flatpak

```
git clone <git repository url>

cd dsnote/flatpak

flatpak-builder --user --install-deps-from=flathub --repo="/path/to/local/flatpak/repo" "/path/to/output/dir" net.mkiol.SpeechNote.yaml

```

### Sailfish OS

```
git clone <git repository url>

cd dsnote
mkdir build
cd build

sfdk config --session specfile=../sfos/harbour-dsnote.spec
sfdk config --session target=SailfishOS-4.4.0.58-aarch64
sfdk cmake ../ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DWITH_SFOS=ON -DWITH_PY=OFF
sfdk package
```

### Linux (direct build)

Speech Note has many build-time and run-time dependencies. This includes shared and static libraries,
3rd-party executables, Python and Perl scripts. Because of these complexity, the recommended way to build
is to use Flatpak tool-chain (Flatpak manifest file and [flatpak-builder](https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/flatpak-builder.html)).
If you want to make a direct build (i.e. without flatpak) it is also possible but more complicated.

```
git clone <git repository url>

cd dsnote
mkdir build
cd build

cmake ../ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DWITH_DESKTOP=ON
make
```

To make build without support for Python components, add `-DWITH_PY=OFF` in cmake step.

To see other build options search for `option(BUILD_XXX)` in `CMakeList.txt` file.

## How to enable a custom model

All models available for download are specified in the configuration file (config/models.json).
To enable a custom model that is compatible with currently supported engines, simply edit this file and restart the application.

When you first run the application, the models configuration file is created in:

- `~/.local/share/net.mkiol/dsnote/models.json`, or
- `~/.var/app/net.mkiol.SpeechNote/data/net.mkiol/dsnote/models.json` (Flatpak), or
- `~/.local/share/org.mkiol/dsnote/models.json` (Sailfish OS)

You can freely edit currently enabled models or add new ones.

Model definition looks like this:

```
{
    "name": "<model name>",
    "model_id": "<model unique id>",
    "engine": "<engine type>",
    "lang_id": "<lang id>",
    "checksum": "<md5 checksum>",
    "checksum_quick": "<partial md5 checksum>",
    "comp": "<compression type",
    "urls": [
        <model URLs>
    ],
    "size": "<download size of all files>"
}
```

Allowed engine types: `stt_ds`, `stt_vosk`, `stt_april`, `stt_whisper`, `stt_fasterwhisper`, `tts_piper`, `tts_rhvoice`, `tts_espeak`, `tts_coqui`, `tts_mimic3`, `mnt_bergamot`

Allowed compression types: `none`, `gz`, `xz`, `tarxz`, `targz`, `zip`, `zipall`, `dir`, `dirgz`

Allowed URL types: `http`, `https`, `file`

Checksums are calculated for all files after unpacking. If you are adding a new model, you can use the `--gen-checksums` command line option to find the right checksums. To do this, put empty strings in both `checksum` and `checksum_quick`, save the file and run Speech Note with the mentioned option.

For example:

```
{
    "name": "New Piper Voice",
    "model_id": "en_piper_new",
    "engine": "tts_piper",
    "lang_id": "en",
    "checksum": "",
    "checksum_quick": "",
    "size": ""
    "comp": "dir",
    "urls": [
        "file:///home/me/models/new-model-medium.onnx",
        "file:///home/me/models/new-model-medium.onnx.json"
    ]
}
```

```
flatpak run net.mkiol.SpeechNote --verbose --gen-checksums
```
