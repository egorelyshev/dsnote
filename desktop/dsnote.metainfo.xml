      <p>Accessibility:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Global keyboard shortcuts.
          Shortcuts allow you to to start or stop listening and reading using keyboard.
          Keyboard shortcuts function even when the application is not active
          (e.g. minimized or in the background)</li>
      <li>Support for 'Actions'. This feature allows external application to
          invoke certain operation when Speech Note is running. An action can
          be triggered via DBus call or with command-line option.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>User Interface:</p>
      <ul>

          to the existing engine for Whisper models, especially on bigger models like Medium or Large.</li>
      <li>New engine: 'April-asr'. It supports intermediate results and punctuation (only English).
          New engine comes with models for the following languages: English, French, Polish.</li>
      <li>Inserting text to any active window. Using global keyboard shotcut or
          'action' you can directly insert the decoded text into any window
          which is currently in focus.</li>
      <li>Copy text to the clipboard. Using global keyboard shotcut or
          'action' the decoded text can be copied to the clipboard
          instead of being inserted into the current note.</li>
      <li>Stop listening button. Unlike Cancel, with this button you can stop listening but
          the already recorded voice will be decoded into text.</li>
      <li>Support for Opus audio codec in 'Transcribe a file'</li>
      <li>More effective GPU acceleration for Whisper models. Average decoding time has been shortened by 3 times.</li>

      <description>
      <p>Speech to Text:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Improved AMD GPU acceleration support for Whisper models.
          Whisper GPU accelerator for AMD cards uses OpenCL interface.
          OpenCL implementation shipped in Flatpak runtime 'Clover'
          does not support new AMD cards.
          To overcome this problem, Speech Note package provides another
          implementation of OpenCL 'ROCm-OpenCL' which supports new AMD hardware.</li>
      </ul>

          an increase in performance. Processing time on CPU has been cut in half on average.</li>
      <li>Improved Nvidia GPU acceleration support for Whisper models.
          Following Whisper accelerators are currently enabled:
          OpenCL (for most Nvidia cards, few AMD cards and Intel GPUs),
          CUDA (for most Nvidia cards).
          GPU hardware acceleration might not work well on your system, therefore is not enabled by default.
          Use the option in 'Settings' to turn it on.
          Disable, if you observe any problems when using Speech to Text with Whisper models.

          show Speech Note under 'Open With' menu in the file manager.
          Please note that Flatpak app only has permission to access files in the following folders:
          Desktop, Documents, Downloads, Music and Videos.</li>
      <li>Improved UI colors when app is running under GNOME dark theme.</li>
